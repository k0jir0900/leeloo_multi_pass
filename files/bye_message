GG, I’m out.
Logging off, good luck!
See you on the next level.
Game over — for now.
Thanks for the match, bye!
Respawning… tomorrow.
AFK for good.
Peace out, player.
Time to touch grass.
Disconnecting from the Matrix.
Bye nerds, I win.
I came, I saw, I logged off.
It’s dangerous to go alone… but I’m going anyway.
I need healing... IRL.
That’s all, folks!
Logging out, stay salty.
See you space cowboy…
The cake was a lie. I’m leaving.
Alt+F4 achieved.
Loot secured, I’m gone.
Victory is mine, farewell.
I’ll BRB... maybe.
Stay frosty.
So long, and thanks for all the frags.
Good fight, good night.
Another quest awaits... tomorrow.
My watch has ended.
The hero has logged off.
Time to return to the real world.
Game saved. Quitting.
My XP bar is full — of sleep.
Escape menu > Quit > Yes.
You either log off as a hero...
Don’t rage quit, just quit.
The adventure ends here — for now.
It's been emotional.
May your ping be low and your crits be high.
Final logout initiated.
Be seeing you.
That’s my last respawn today.
Time to uninstall life.
My mana’s out, peace!
The boss fight is real — it’s called “life.”
Bye, I need to go level up in sleep.
PvP off. Logging off.
My inventory is full — of regret.
GG, no re.
I’m going to go save the world... in another game.
Time to grind XP elsewhere.
Rage quitting with class — bye!
